<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Start issue tracking workflow, user start workflow is who reports the issue.
* Fill in the information in the issue tracking document.
* If the report user coincides with QC then the test case id is required. Otherwise, the task goes to QC in charge to fill test case id.
* Submit an issue to the dev for approval.
* Dev approval or rejects the issue or requests to update the information.
* The system automatically changes the status and last day update status of that issue.
* If the issue is approved, the dev will receive a task has an action fixed
* If the dev is fixed the issue, the dev will execute action fixed. Dev will go to a task to fill error cause group, detailed error cause, solution, release environment, version release, processing time.
* If the dev updates the issue, QA test again the issue, QA has three actions: DONE, CLOSE, RE-OPEN.
* If the issue still occurs, QA will return it to the dev to review it.
* Dev will have two actions: Not an error or fixed.
* If the issue is done, notice will send to the dev.
