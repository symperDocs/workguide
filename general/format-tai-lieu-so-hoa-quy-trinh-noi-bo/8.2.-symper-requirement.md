# 8.2. SYMPER REQUIREMENT

#### 8.1.1. Subject content title

Requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy. It is commonly used in a formal sense in engineering design, including for example in systems engineering, software engineering, or enterprise engineering. It is a broad concept that could speak to any necessary (or sometimes desired) function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, internal user, or other stakeholder. Requirements can come with different levels of specificity

#### 8.1.2. Meaning of the object in the application

* Requirement management: Process of documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders... A requirement is a capability to which a project outcome (product or service) should conform
* Symper requirement manages requirements based on modules, each member of each department will be in charge of small features, helping to closely manage the quality of the requirement as well as reach maximum coverage in testing.
* Symper Requirement will be broken down into a hierarchical tree structure of requirements (system functionalities, user features, use cases).
* SRS serves the BA to define and design a feature in the system. SRS is based on business requirements, system requirements, or requirements that have been broken down to meet a project deliverable.
* SRS is the place for DEV and Three to exchange the system's feature latches. Determine the personnel to perform the work. Manage changes in requirements, and features built in which version of the software development process.
* Business required:&#x20;

1. SRS inherits from deliverable ids and project charter IDs if SRS source is from project charter (Optional);&#x20;
2. If all requirements of a deliverable have been processed, the deliverable will change to DONE status (All req of a deliverable -> DONE). Any requirement that is inherited from the project charter will change the status of the project to WIP

1. Start Requirement workflow
2. 2.Fill the information in the project charter document
3. 3.Submit requirement to the manager for approval
4. 4.Manager approves or requests to update the information
5. 5.System automatically Change the status of that project
6. 6.Notice to relevant departments and members

**States of Requirement**![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mf66kQb8ODpdujUHM5j%2Fuploads%2F7ABAEf8oQtLeEAkiMXPf%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=16cb7905-399b-4ed1-9c1b-16fd2199cf3f)\


* NEW: New requirement created and not started yet&#x20;
* CLOSED: Requirement has been closed and no longer available&#x20;
* BACKLOG: A list of tasks required to support a larger strategic plan
* WIP: DEV department is implementing the code&#x20;
* DONE: Has reached the end of the Requirement implementation phase and is over&#x20;

**Describe WBS workflow**

After a user submits the REQUIREMENT, if the assignee is them, the REQUIREMENT will be delivered to the manager of that department for approval, depending on which department the individual belongs to. Managers have three choices for approving workerâ€™s work schedules in the department:

If the manager selects "Update," the REQUIREMENT is returned to its assignee so that it may be updated more explicitly. Once the change is completed, the REQUIREMENT will be forwarded back to their manager.&#x20;

If the manager chooses "Disapproval" the status of that REQUIREMENT is instantly changed to "Closed," and the procedure is terminated.

If the manager chooses "Approval," the status of that REQUIREMENT is updated to "Approved" and the procedure is terminated.
