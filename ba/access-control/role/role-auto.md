# Role Auto

## OVERVIEW

Role Auto: is a role that aggregates the permissions to which all user roles are authorized. Role automatically works in the following cases:

* When all roles have permission, the automatic role also has permission.
* When one of all the roles has permission, the role automatically has permission too.

Automatic roles don't have permission to perform actions when all roles aren't authorized.
