# OKRs

## 1. Overall

OKRs stand for Objectives and Key Results.

In which, an Objective simply refers to what needs to be achieved. Therefore, following the objectives is important, concrete, action-oriented, and usefully motivating. They are cures against fuzziness and ineffectiveness when properly conceived and implemented.

Simultaneously, Key Results serve as a baseline for determining how close an organization is to achieving the goal - Objective. KRs that work are detailed, time-bound, and aggressive while being realistic. They are, above all, measurable and verifiable. There is no gray area, no space for question when it comes to meeting the requirements of a crucial result. The organization does a periodical check at the conclusion of the defined period, usually a quarter, and grades the important findings as fulfilled or not.

Whereas an Objective can be extended for a year or more, Key Results change as the project advances. The Objective will be fulfilled once all of them have been performed.

## 2. Building OKRs

OKR is a goal-setting process that allows teams and individuals to set tough, ambitious goals that can be measured. OKRs are a way to keep track of progress, build alignment, and encourage engagement in measurable goals.

There are two way to approach an OKR

#### Top-down&#x20;

In a top-down strategy, management or administration develops a mission statement or set of goals and attempts to persuade employees from the top down. In a top-down approach, OKRs would imply that a manager, supervisor, or administrator sets all objectives.

#### Bottom-up

Employees or teams using a bottom-up method simply construct a more realistic mission statement or goals but lack the challenge. Employees define their objectives and key results based on what they believe should be done in the instance of OKR and try to persuade other employees and management from the bottom up.

Beside the approach, OKR can be horizontally aligned to become more appropriate and ensure balance of objectives and benefits between departments of the organization.

## 3. OKRs in SYMPER

OKR is adapted in SYMPER to guide the whole organization towards the same goal. On the concept of OKR, SYMPER focuses on the year-planning based on the objectives which can be measured through the key results. The year objectives usually are divided into the parts for each quarter.

Building the OKR in SYMPER always tends to be clear, realistic, ambitious and challenging through approaching the objectives with the flexible combination between top-down and bottom-up and having the great communication between all SYMPER’s departments to be unified.

Through the numbers for gauging progress to keep the plan on track, if the objectives measured by key results can be all fulfilled, which means that being enabled to reach 100% OKR, it can be harmful for the organization. It can show that the organization ‘s plan is so easy and all the resources are not used optimally for the development.

However all the objectives can be done 60% or more to show that the greatly positive result, the rate between 40% and 60% is not totally negative because it can be a chance for the organization to understand itself more and find out all the problems for improving the next period result. Obviously, lower than 40% is a really bad result meaning that all the aspects need to change positively immediately.
