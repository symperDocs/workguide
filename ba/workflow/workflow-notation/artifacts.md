# Artifacts

## Definition

Additional information that developers add to bring a necessary level of detail to the diagram.&#x20;

### Data Object

A Data Object represents information flowing through the process, such as business document, e-mail, or letters

A Data Object shows what data is necessary for an activity.&#x20;

### Data Store

A Data Store is a place where the process can read or write data.

Example: A database or a filing cabinet. It persists beyond the lifetime of the process instance.

### Group

A group shows a logical grouping of activities but doesn’t change the diagram’s flow

Like all artifacts, group do not influence execution semantics, so don't confuse them with things like subprocesses. You can apply groups any way you like - even across pool boundaries. Groups can be extremely usegul for making off parts of your models to which only certain convention apply

### Annotation

An annotation provides further explanation to a part of the diagram.

We use notation to supplement your diagram. Annotations can contain almost anything you find useful, and you can connect element with associations. Usually, we use annotations to provide insight

To use [Annotations](artifacts.md#annotation), it can be used for any object by clicking on that object and selecting the icon
