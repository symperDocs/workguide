The picture above is the overview dashboard of WBS. The WBS report, depending on the chart, will show the number of WBS by their state, the number of WBS by module and their status. When we filter by executor, the report shows the WBS details that the person entered as well as their start and end times. Currently, Symper employees enter WBS every day and will show their daily WBS at the check-in meeting that day.
