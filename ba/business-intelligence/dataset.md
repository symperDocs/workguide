# Dataset

A dataset is a collection of data that you import or connect to. Symper BI lets you connect to and import all sorts of datasets and bring all of it together in one place. Datasets can also source data from dataflows or documents. Visualizations from that one dataset can display on many different dashboards.

To view the list of existing datasets, first, click on "**Báo cáo**" then choose "**Danh sách dataset**". Or if you click on "**Danh sách dataset đã xóa**", list of deleted datasets will be shown immediately.

The screen will show you these components as below:

1. **ID**: The ID of every dataset, each dataset has a unique ID.
2. **Name**: The name of the dataset. They are always lowercase and without spaces, joined by underscores.
3. **Table.Alias name**: The dataset title is synchronized with the document title.
4. **Table type**: if a dataset is saved from a document, it will display "doc." If the dataset is saved from a dataflow, it appears as "dataset by dataflow" otherwise.
5. **The created time**: The time that the dataset was created.
6. **The updated time**: The time that the dataset was last modified and updated.
7. **TableSymperID**: is the document ID that includes the table from which the dataset gets information; hence, datasets saved from dataflow will not have an ID and this column will display as "0."
8. **The search box**: to search datasets that you want to view
9. **Create**: To create a new dataset
10. **Refresh**: To refresh the page
11. **Export excel**: To export a dataset into excel
12. **Filter**: To add a filter or filter the dataset according to any conditions.
13. **Configuration**: to set and format how you view the dataset

Click on any dataset you want to view or edit and select "**Sửa**", it will take you to the dataflow containing that dataset. Or if you want to delete the dataset when it is no longer needed, simply select "**Xóa**".
