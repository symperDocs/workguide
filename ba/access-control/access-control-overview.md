# Access Control Overview

### Overview

Access Control ensures individuals in an organization can access and use company information and resources to do their tasks.

2 phases of protection:

* The first phase: identity verification
* The second phase: access control: deciding what and how users can do with the system

### Components in access control

Filter configuration: decentralize execution of actions to 1 or more parts of an object on the system depending on how the creator configured it.

Action pack (access package): a collection of interactive actions with objects in the system (eg viewing, editing, deleting, ...)

Permission: a set of action packs that authorized users allow to perform.

User Role: a set of access rights assigned to Role

### The relationship between components

Access Control of Symper relies on The RBAC model – access permissions based on role, control, and limit user’s right to use.

This means each subject has one or more roles, each role contains one or more permissions that allow execution of actions such as view, add, edit, etc. to many objects in the system. The subjects in the business will be represented through the Organization chart – a small part in the large module Access Control provided by Symper.
