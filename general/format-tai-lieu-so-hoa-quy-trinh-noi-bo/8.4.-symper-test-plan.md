## **8.4.1. Subject content title**

**Test Plan** is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product. Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process, which is minutely monitored and controlled by the test manager.

## 8.4.2. Meaning of the object in the application

* Help all members of the project, not only the testing team understand the details of how to test as well as understand the scope of the test.
* Test Plan is also one of the documents proving the quality of software testing of Party B during project implementation. A good test plan can even be used as a reference by the customer during the UAT process, which is one of the advantages of the implementation process.
* Test Plan helps everyone in the team look in the same direction, from strategy to implementation. It is like a set of rules, which need to be followed. That creates synchronization in the testing process, helping test leads or PMs to easily control the test progress or handle problems when problems occur.
* Other important aspects in the test plan like estimation, test scope, test strategy are recorded, so team lead/PM/company can review and reuse for other projects.

## 8.4.4. Workflow

**a) Create a test plan**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (40) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Start Test Plan workflow.
* Fill in the information in the Test Plan document.
* Submit Test Plan to the manager for approval.
* The manager approves, cancels, or requests to update the information.
* The system automatically changes the status of that project.
* Notice to relevant departments and members.

**Status of test plan**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Staus of test</p></figcaption></figure>

* NEW: New test plan created and not approved yet
* APPROVAL: Test plan approval
* DISAPPROVAL: The test plan has not been approved

**Describe TEST PLAN workflow**

The test plan creator will be the leader and the approver is the leader of the leader's department (Project manager). After the leader submits the test plan:

In case the leader and project manager are two different people after the leader submits the test plan, the test plan will be transferred to the project manager for approval. The project manager has 3 options for approval:

* If the project manager selects "Update", the TEST PLAN will be returned to the leader for the leader to update the test plan more clearly. Once the change is complete, the TEST PLAN will be forwarded back to the project manager.
* If the project manager selects "Not Approved", the TEST PLAN status will immediately change to "DISAPPROVAL" and will send a message "Test plan has been canceled" to the leader, the process will end.
* If the project manager selects "Approved", the status of that TEST PLAN will be updated to "APPROVAL" and will send a message "Test plan approved" to the leader, the process will end.

In case the leader and project manager are the same people, no more approval is needed and the test plan status will be updated to "Approved" and the procedure is over.

#### **b) Update test plan**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Update test plan by process

In case the leader and project manager are two different people after the leader updates the test plan, the status of the doc test plan will be changed from "Approved" to "Pending for approval" and transferred to the project manager for approval. The project manager has 3 options for approval:

* If the project manager selects "Update", the TEST PLAN will be returned to the leader for the leader to update the test plan more clearly. Once the change is complete, the TEST PLAN will be forwarded back to the project manager.
* If the project manager selects "Not Approved", the TEST PLAN status will immediately change to "DISAPPROVAL" and will send a message "Test plan has been canceled" to the leader, the process will end.
* If the project manager selects "Approved", the status of that TEST PLAN will be updated to "APPROVAL" and will send a message "Test plan approved" to the leader, the process will end.

In case the leader and project manager are the same people, there will be no need to approve, no need to update the doc test plan status anymore, but it will end.
