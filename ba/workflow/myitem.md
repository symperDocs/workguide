### **Work**

To view each Workflow instance, we will first click to the My Item section on the lefft and then use the filter to select the "Công việc" section to display all of the Workflow instances we require to view

There are components that display in the My item's work:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>My item's work</p></figcaption></figure>

1. Name and secondary information of the workflow instance
2. The created time
3. The created person
4. The application that the workflow instance is located
5. The status of the workflow instance: incomplete or complete

If you click on a work (also known as a workflow instance), it will display the tasks related to that process flow as well as the status of each task.

If the user is not authorized in the WF or has not reached the step of being authorized, the colored action buttons that you can perform with the document will not appear above.

Conversely, when you have authority in the process, for example when it comes to a step that requires your approval, in the upper corner will appear 3 different options for you to choose, including: 'Gửi', 'Gửi và thêm mới' and 'Hành động'.

* Gửi: to save and send the instance but not complete the process
* Gửi và thêm mới: to send to document without end this step, then continue to fill a new document
* Hành động: contains 3 action options to do after you chose 'Gửi' or 'Gửi và thêm mới':
  * Giao việc: to delegate this work to someone else, but they have no authority other than to fill and submit the document.
  * Ủy quyền: to delegate the work and full authority you have with the document to someone else.
  * Hoàn thành: to send to document and end this step to move to another in the process.
