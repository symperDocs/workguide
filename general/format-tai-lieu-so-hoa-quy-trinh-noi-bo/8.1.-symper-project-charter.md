# 8.1. SYMPER PROJECT CHARTER

### **8.1.0. Project Definition**

A project is defined as a sequence of tasks that must be completed to attain a certain outcome. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), the term Project refers to ” to any temporary endeavor with a definite beginning and end”. Depending on its complexity, it can be managed by a single person or hundreds.

A project is a set of interdependent tasks that have a common goal. Projects have the following characteristics:

Simply put, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a specific outcome. A project can also be defined as a set of inputs and outputs required to achieve a particular goal. Projects can range from simple to complex and can be managed by one person or a hundred. Projects are often described and delegated by a manager or executive. They go over their expectations and goals, and it's up to the team to manage logistics and execute the project on time. Sometimes deadlines can be given. For good project productivity, some teams break it up into individual tasks to manage accountability and utilize team strengths.

#### 8.1.1. Subject content title

The PMI defines a project charter as “a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project, and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.”

#### 8.1.2. Meaning of the object in the application

* Project is the process that serves to control the process of creating projects in the Symper system. Project must ensure that the scope, start time, and end time of the project are defined. Identify the deliverables to be completed of the project, Project Resources.
* Project is the starting point of defining the product, service, or expected outcome. At Symper, the project will be the basic source of information for the participating departments to rely on to build plans and plan jobs

**8.1.3. Form and meaning of the information fields**

**Some important definitions**

* **Milestone:** Milestone is a specific point within a project’s life cycle used to measure the progress toward the ultimate goal. Milestones in project management are used as signal posts for a project's start or end date, external reviews or input, budget checks, submission of a major deliverable, etc. A milestone is a reference point that marks a significant event or a branching decision point within a project **(A milestone may include one or more deliverables)**
* **Deliverable:** The word "deliverables" is a project management term describing the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project. Projects create deliverables, which are simply the results of the project or the processes in the project. That means a deliverable can be something as big as the objective of the project itself or the reporting that is part of the larger project. Deliverables can be tangible or intangible in nature&#x20;
* **Manager of the Department** means a Corporation employee designated to oversee the administration of the Department (BA, QC, DEV,...)
*   **RACI:** A **responsibility assignment matrix**, also known as **RACI matrix** describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. RACI is an acronym derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: _**responsible**_, ** **_**accountable**_, ** **_**consulted**_, **** and _**informed**_. It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes. There are a number of alternatives to the RACI model.

#### 8.1.4. Workflow

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



1. Start project charter workflow
2. Fill the information in the project charter document
3. Submit the project charter to the manager for approval and discuss the scoring plan for each part
4. Manager approves or requests to update the information
5. System automatically Change the status of that project
6. Notice to relevant departments and members

**States of Project Charter**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



* NEW: New Project created and not started yet
* CLOSED: Project has been closed and no longer available
* BACKLOG: A list of tasks required to support a larger strategic plan
* WIP: The project is in the process
* DONE: Has reached the end of the Project implementation phase and is over

**Describe of Project Charter workflow**Step 1: Start the process at the workflow list in my application(Intern does not have sufficient permissions to start the process)Step 2: Fill in the form submit then press submit and done![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mf66kQb8ODpdujUHM5j%2Fuploads%2Fv853a5ZDakth2aNrk0iX%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=90fef1eb-1a02-4020-a914-f91c5116dcd7)\
Step 3: After a user submits the Project charter, if the assignee is them, the Project charter will be delivered to the manager of that department for approval, depending on which department the individual belongs to.

&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Step 4: Managers have three choices for approving worker’s work schedules in the department:

If (BA, QC, DEV) Junior starts the process then LEAD or Manager of Department can approve

If (BA, QC, DEV) Lead start the process then only Manager of Department can approve

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the manager selects "Update," the Project charter is returned to its assignee so that it may be updated more explicitly. Once the change is completed, the Project charter will be forwarded back to their manager.&#x20;

If the manager chooses "Disapproval" the status of that Project charter is instantly changed to "Closed," and the procedure is terminated.&#x20;

If the manager chooses "Approval," the status of that Project charter is updated to "Approved" and the procedure is terminated.

Step 5: After that, this node&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png>) will update the corresponding state for that document, If the manager selects "Update", the status will automatically change to **UPDATE**. Manager selects "Approval", the status will automatically change to **APPROVED**. Manager selects "Disapproval", the status will automatically change to **CLOSED**

Step 6: System sends notifications to relevant departments (Relevant departments are BA, QC, DEV departments, including members who assigned tasks in the project)&#x20;

Members are the people assigned in the project team

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Notification</p></figcaption></figure>

After that, the specified project charter workflow will end, the project is approved and implementation begins
