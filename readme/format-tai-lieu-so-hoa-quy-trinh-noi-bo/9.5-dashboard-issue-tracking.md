# 9.5 DASHBOARD ISSUE TRACKING

​The picture above is the overview dashboard of Issue tracking. The issue tracking report, depending on the chart, will show the number of issues by status, module, priority, new issues and fixed every day, sprint, tester, or dev. When we filter by date, the report shows the issues in that period.​

​In addition, we can view the issue details on the table chart. We can filter by date, status, priority, dev lead, reporter, version, sprint id, environment, requirement, module name of the issue.
