With input data as documents as shown in the image, respectively requirement, sprint, test case and bug tracking

Use node "load" ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png>) to load the input data. Then select the fields to display and filter in the right sidebar as shown in the image

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, filter the records where the [requirement ](8.2.-symper-requirement.md)id is empty. Use node filter and append output from Requirement to that filter like image ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png>) The results corresponding to the filter will be returned below when click RUN ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1).png>)button

Next, left join ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>) the [requirement](8.2.-symper-requirement.md) document with the [sprint ](8.7.-sprint.md)document to filter out the requirements that are scheduled for processing. Knowing the precise plan of requirements and which department members are in charge of it is the next step.

From the data available above (Requirements id, description, related members,...), continue to left join them with the test case to see if those requirements are tested

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Left join with Test case</p></figcaption></figure>

We continue to left join with the above input data with [issue tracking ](8.6-issue-tracking.md)to know is a problem in the test case or not? It generates the report in a proper format that includes the number of test cases executed, the number of failed test cases, and the test cases that have been skipped

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Left join with ISSUE TRACKING</p></figcaption></figure>

We have compiled the number of issues based on requirements, sprints and test cases. Next is to count the number of bugs based on the state (DONE, NEW, TOTAL BUG)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, use node Summarize ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (2).png>) to aggregate and count the requirement IDs according to the parent requirements

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To aggregate according to the parent requirement, select count for tb1\_id so that the result is the total number of child requirements

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Count Requirement Child</p></figcaption></figure>

Same for counting test cases based on requirements to ensure test coverage (Test coverage monitors the number of tests that have been executed)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Count Test case</p></figcaption></figure>

Finally, we have information about the number of requirements, the number of test cases and the number of bugs by state, we fully join them together as shown in the picture.
