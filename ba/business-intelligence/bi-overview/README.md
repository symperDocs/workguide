## Relationship of BI to other modules

BI uses data collected from documents to analyze and display reports. The two input data sources of BI are document and dataset. For large and complex data, it is necessary to put them into a dataset to filter and process before entering BI.

## Components in BI

BI includes 4 small modules, respectively Dashboard, Dataflow, Dataset and Relation.&#x20;

Dashboard is used to present data and reports to users.&#x20;

Dataflow is a place to process and "process" data to avoid data being mixed up and not accurately representing business information.&#x20;

Dataset is the data table that has been processed in dataflow and is one of the two inputs to the dashboard.&#x20;

Relation creates relationships between elements in different datasets, making it more convenient to filter your data.
