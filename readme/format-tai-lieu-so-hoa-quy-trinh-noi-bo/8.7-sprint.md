# 8.7 Sprint

## 8.7.1. Subject content title

A sprint is a period (e.g., 14 days) for plan in which an agreed-upon set of development tasks takes place. Sprint lengths vary by organization but often last less than one month. If something is too large for a single sprint, it’s broken down into smaller components and spread across more than one.

## 8.7.2. Meaning of the object in the application

Giving out sprints makes project execution easier when employees have smaller schedules so they don't miss tasks or because one job goes wrong and the entire project suffers. Breaking the project down into sprints will help administrators and employees adapt more quickly if there are any problems during project implementation.

## 8.7.4. Flowcharts

When an employee begins the Sprint process, the first thing he or she does is fill out the Sprint document and submit it. The process will then deliver the Sprint document that was just given to the BA department manager for approval. They will have three choices to reroute the process, including accepting the Sprint, rejecting the Sprint, or requesting the person who launched the process to update his/her Sprint again.

If the BA manager approves the sprint, the process will modify the sprint's status to "BA Approved." The material will then be forwarded to the Dev department's manager for further review. If the sprint is approved by the Dev manager, its status will be updated to "Approved," otherwise it will be changed to "Closed."

If the BA manager declines to authorize the sprint, the sprint's status will be changed to "Closed."If the BA manager wants additional sprint update, the process will send the Sprint document back to its originator, who will amend it before sending it back to the BA manager for approval.

After the Sprint state is changed, the process will be terminated.
