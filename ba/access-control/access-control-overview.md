# Access Control Overview

### Overview

Access Control ensures that individuals in an organization can access and use company's information and resources to do their tasks.

There are 2 phases of protection:

* The first phase: identity verification
* The second phase: access control - deciding what and how users can do with the system

### Components in access control

Filter configuration: decentralizes the execution of actions to 1 or more parts of an object in the system depending on how the creator configured it.

Action pack (access package): a collection of interactive actions with objects in the system (e.g. viewing, editing, deleting,...)

Permission: a set of action packs that authorize users to perform.

User Role: a set of access rights assigned to user role

Org Chart: a set of access rights assigned to Departments or Positions

### The relationship between components

Access Control of Symper relies on The RBAC model – access permission based on role, control, and limit user’s right to use.

This means each subject has one or more roles, each role contains one or more permissions that allow the execution of actions such as view, add, edit, etc. to many objects in the system. The subjects in the business will be represented through the Organization chart – a small part in the large module Access Control provided by Symper.
