# 8.8 WBS

## 8.8.1. Subject content title

WBS stands for Work Breakdown Structure. As the name suggests, WBS is a method for decomposing and structuring work objects throughout the scope of a project.The components of the work breakdown structure can be products, data packages, service packages, work packages, or any combination. The work breakdown structure also provides the necessary framework for detailed estimating and cost control, along with providing guidance for development and schedule control

## 8.8.2. Meaning of the object in the application <a href="#8.8.2.-y-nghia-cua-doi-tuong-trong-ung-dung" id="8.8.2.-y-nghia-cua-doi-tuong-trong-ung-dung"></a>

* Creating a common perception at work: Through WBS, the work contents of the project are transparent, thereby reducing the deviation of the scope of work with the person in charge of that work.
* Build a schedule for the project: By breaking down the work into smaller pieces, we can clearly see the time and resources for each task and plan the allocation for those tasks.
* Reduce project risk: Building a good WBS will help reveal problems early in the project. When a problem, good or bad, is reflected in the WBS, as project managers we can quickly gauge its impact on the whole process through a clear work hierarchy
* Project progress is continuously adjusted and improved When decentralizing work, managers can set deadlines and assign detailed permissions for each job. As a result, work delays can be more easily controlled and remedied through warnings and reminders. At the same time, it is easy to grasp the cause, who is responsible for those delays. Then, the project progress control will become more timely, effective and detailed.

When an employee begins the Sprint process, the first thing he or she does is fill out the Sprint document and submit it. The process will then deliver the Sprint document that was just given to the BA department manager for approval. They will have three choices to reroute the process, including accepting the Sprint, rejecting the Sprint, or requesting the person who launched the process to update his/her Sprint again.

If the BA manager approves the sprint, the process will modify the sprint's status to "BA Approved." The material will then be forwarded to the Dev department's manager for further review. If the sprint is approved by the Dev manager, its status will be updated to "Approved," otherwise it will be changed to "Closed."

If the BA manager declines to authorize the sprint, the sprint's status will be changed to "Closed."If the BA manager wants additional sprint update, the process will send the Sprint document back to its originator, who will amend it before sending it back to the BA manager for approval.

After the Sprint state is changed, the process will be terminated.
