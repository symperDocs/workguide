**Test Plan** is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product. Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process, which is minutely monitored and controlled by the test manager.

* Help all members of the project, not only the testing team understand the details of how to test as well as understand the scope of the test.
* Test Plan is also one of the documents proving the quality of software testing of Party B during project implementation. A good test plan can even be used as a reference by the customer during the UAT process, which is one of the advantages of the implementation process.
* Test Plan helps everyone in the team look in the same direction, from strategy to implementation. It is like a set of rules, which need to be followed. That creates synchronization in the testing process, helping test leads or PMs to easily control the test progress or handle problems when problems occur.
* Other important aspects in the test plan like estimation, test scope, test strategy are recorded, so team lead/PM/company can review and reuse for other projects.
