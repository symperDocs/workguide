# 8.9 Service version control

## 8.9.1. Subject content title

**Symper Service Version Control** is used for managing code versions of each service in Symper platform over time. It helps devops team, project manager and all the stakeholders to control changes of the software (including new feature and fixed bugs) after the service code is updated.

## 8.9.2. Meaning of the object in the application

* As mentioned above, service version control document recognizes all improvements in the services. This document could clarify changes in different type and contain detailed description of the updates. Because Symper platform is built in micro-service structure, changes are managed in the scope of each service. Whenever there is update in service, its version will increase by a unit, tracking all modifications over some/many service version till the whole platform version is updated.
* Allow team to recognize changes to modify relevant platform documentation and release note to the public

## **8.9.3. Document form and meaning of the information fields**

## 8.9.4. Workflow

Slightly different from other documents in project **"Internal network"**, the Symper Service version control is not run by workflow in the Symper platform directly. Instead, whenever the Devops team merge new code from branches, the ID of requirements and ID of issues are required to be merged. From then, Devops team can identify types of modification, ID of modification and also all other informations needed for Symper service version control document record to be generated.

In short, right after the new code is merged, new Symper service version control is created to realize the changes.
