_One-to-one relationship: A one-to-one (1:1) relationship exists when zero or one instance of entity A can be associated with zero or one instance of entity B, and zero or one instance of entity B can be associated with zero or one instance of entity A. (abbreviated 1:1)_

_One-to-many relationship: (abbreviated 1:N): A one-to-many (1:N) relationship exists when, for one instance of entity A, there exists zero, one, or many instances of entity B; but for one instance of entity B, there exists zero or one instance of entity A._

_Many-to-many relationship: A many-to-many (N:N) relationship exists when, for one instance of entity A, there exists zero, one, or many instances of entity B; and for one instance of entity B, there exists zero, one, or many instances of entity A. (abbreviated N:N)_
