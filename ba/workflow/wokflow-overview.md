# Workflow Overview

## Overview

Workflow is one of four main element modules of Symper platform. It helps automate all or part of business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information, or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules that have been configured before. Data used to run the inherited processes from the [Document Module](broken-reference) and Approval Processes authenticated by [Access Control](broken-reference)

## Concept

A workflow is a method of listing repeatable steps for a business process or activity. The steps in a workflow typically have a specific sequence or flow from one stage to the next until the process or activity is complete. The major benefit of using a workflow is that everyone using it completes the business process or activity the same way every time. This is especially useful with very large workforces to streamline tasks involving multiple people, show what tasks to complete, list who handles tasks and indicate how long tasks should take. Symper BPMN is built on BPMN 2.0

### What is BPMN?

Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a flow chart method that models the steps of a planned business process from end to end. A key to Business Process Management, it visually depicts a detailed sequence of business activities and information flows needed to complete a process.

## Purpose and benefits

At a high level, BPMN is targeted at participants and other stakeholders in a business process to gain understanding through an easy-to-understand visual representation of the steps. At a more involved level, itâ€™s targeted at the people who will implement the process, giving sufficient detail to enable precise implementation. It provides a standard, common language for all stakeholders, whether technical or non-technical: business analysts, process participants, managers and technical developers, as well as external teams and consultants. Ideally, it bridges the gap between process intention and implementation by providing sufficient detail and clarity into the sequence of business activities.

Workflow management software essentially creates a categorized to-do list or checklist that can help organize step-by-step processes. Almost any process is ideal for turning into a workflow diagram or checklist. Looking at examples of ways to use workflows can help you to:

* Improve business operations
* Eliminate redundant actions
* Reduce costs and expenses
* Create automated processes
* Educate team members or management
* Promote company objectives

## BPMN 2.0 diagram elements and symbols

BPMN depicts these four element types for business process diagrams:
