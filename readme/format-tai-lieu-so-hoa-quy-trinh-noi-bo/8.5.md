## **8.5.1. Subject content title**

**Test suites**: It can identify gaps in a testing effort where the successful completion of one test case must occur before you begin the next test case. For instance, you cannot add new products to a shopping cart before you successfully log in to the application. When you run a test suite in sequential mode, you can choose to stop the suite execution if a single test case does not pass. Stopping the execution is useful if running a test case in a test suite depends on the success of previous test cases

## **8.5.2. Meaning of the object in the application**

Test suites are also useful for the following types of tests:

* Build verification tests: A collection of test cases that perform a basic validation of most the functional areas in the product. The tests are executed after each product build and before the build is promoted for use by a larger audience.
* Smoke tests: A collection of test cases that ensure basic product functionality. Typically, smoke tests are the first level of testing that is performed after changes are made to the system under test.
* End-to-End integration tests: A collection of test cases that cross product boundaries and ensure that the integration points between products are exercised and validated.
* Functional verification tests: A collection of test cases that focus on a specific product function. Executing this type of test with a test suite ensures that several aspects of a specific feature are tested.
* Regression tests: A collection of test cases that are used to make a regression pass over functional product areas.
